## 1. About The Project
SLPScribe, or the Specch Language Pathologist Transcriber, is a specialized freelance project that aims to assist language pathologists and other similar professionals in their daily work. This project aims to streamline the process of recording and transcribing conversations by providing a user-friendly and efficient solution. By utilizing advanced audio-to-text technology, SLPScribe automatically converts recorded conversations into editable transcripts, making it easier for users to cross-reference and make modifications.
The transcripts can be easily exported to Microsoft Word or Google Docs, or downloaded for added flexibility. In addition to its core transcription capabilities, SLPScribe also includes a powerful text editor with advanced formatting and editing tools, allowing for hassle-free corrections and modifications. The application was designed with ease of use in mind, with the goal of simplifying the workflow of language pathologists and other similar professionals.

## 2. Project Inspiration
This project was a rewarding challenge for me as a freelance software developer. I wanted to use my technical skills to create a high-quality application that supports speech-language pathologists in their work. My goal was to design an efficient and easy to use solution that reduces the administrative burden on SLPs, and allows them to focus more on providing high-quality service to their clients.
